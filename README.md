## Abstract

> Testing database applications in Java and Clojure - a practical guide to system tests.

When programmers want to verify that the application works as a whole,
they face specific challenges.
Such "system tests" should strive to accomplish some general goals,
that aim at avoiding common pitfalls
and ensuring that the programmers' efforts are expended effectively.
The talk explores time-tested, successful practices for writing
system tests.
While the practices are generic,
specific tools are introduced to assist writing the tests in Java and Clojure ecosystems.
Finally, the system tests benefits are assessed
and system tests are compared with unit tests,
drawing a conclusion about best testing strategy as of today.
